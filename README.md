###  Bank Marketing Decision Tree Classifier

### Project Overview
This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

**Dataset:** Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Repository)  
**Language:** Python  
**Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
**Libraries Used:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Steps Performed
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data visualization (15 charts including pie, bar, violin, etc.)  
3. Data preprocessing using Label Encoding  
4. Model training using Decision Tree Classifier  
5. Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report  
6. Decision Tree visualization  
7. Conclusion and insights

### Model Result
**Algorithm:** Decision Tree 
**Max Depth:** 5  
**Accuracy:** 91.36% 

---

### Conclusion
The Decision Tree model effectively predicts customer purchase behavior using demographic and behavioral attributes. Features such as **duration**, **job type**, and **contact method** are found to be strong indicators of purchase decisions.
